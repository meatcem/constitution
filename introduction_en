yesterday the Egyptian went to the streets, tore the image of sisi, called for his departure, clashed with the police, and some failed to meet the future, and others were put behind bars,they are muzzled forces, to be unleashed, but the police forces had two different behaviors, a schism was obvious, why the protestors left them  arrest other protestors? why they are afraid, why the females weren't afraid as much, why thought they were protected, but the Egyptian male is weaker, he isn't protected, the line of humanity, and virtue between him, and the other Egyptian protestor, or police officer is cut, they clump into two groups clashing, but the connections against the protestors are stronger, in the French revolution the protestors went to the streets out of hunger, they clashed with, and killed the guards, where the Egyptians were heading to? they are moving toward a new form of power that can contain their anger, stable power, but how the protestors stand against the police arms, and how they can escape this trap set before them? the solution is in defining a purpose, they still repeat the same emblems of 8 years ago, they even call for the departure of sisi while he is away! they didn't take the chance, to move forward, but where they can move forward, or to what end?
the same Egyptians 8 years ago, called for populist leader, how can take their hands, the egyptians acts as a young shy virgin waiting for her masculine hero, to escape in his hand, and fall in his hands, the Egyptians still persist on their defeatists behavior, and they excpect a change, they didn't demand any change 8 years ago, they didn't define freedom, and justice, and bread, they didn't take the responsiblity to solve this problems, and they got none of these, they aren't aware that the whole state, and region, North Africa, and Middle East lacking the expertise, and imagination, even lacking the intellectuals who can solve those problems, they take the approach of the orientalists for solving those problems, they try to expand the definitions of freedom, and justice, and scale it on the western reality, they completely ignore the troubles beneath those western definitions, or inside the western state, they ignore the corruption, exploitation of the every Middle East, North Africa, and third world as the core of their glamourous state, and richness, they completely ignore the contemporary rising problems in bBriten, Spain, US, and France, the whole western definition are exhausted, and they exhausted when their sources of exploitation of western banking are drained, any resistance, or natural progressive development in the region affect them negatively, they can't survive without exploitation, definition of the justice, freedom, and bread on the western scale requires dominated entity to be exploitated, require a weaker entity, but there isn't weaker entity to us than the citizen, and individal, the western definitions of justice, freedom, and bread will faild to be scaled upon our reality, our revolution is a revolution against the western defintion that subjugate us to their western banking system, and corporations, Middle Eastern intellectuals are assmiliated to western ideology, regressed as orientalists, they ignore the disturbing reality of the west, but why?
that is the best they know, they lack any imagination for a different word, the carpenter for example can't visualize a solution for sickness, the solutions to the region are directly linked to the global crisis, economically, ecologically, for the latter follows from the former, the economics is the driving of those western liberal definitions, those historians, sociologists, or philosophers, have no solution beyond the developments in the history, rather than the turning points, they can't imagine a different solution of the problems, they can't see the truth of individual, group, and society, they fail to define the relation between them, they repeat again, and again the western definitions of democracy, the ability of the western individual to stand against decision-makers, giving a blind eye to the demagoguery of the dominating power, and it's capability to reshape the public opinion. their sense of inferiority, and dwarfism from the oppressing regimes make them long for a higher power, of any kind, they aren't ambitious enough, power at the end is the drive of our behavior, but they lack the wise prediction of the future, they lack the vision to the consequence of their writings, words, and belives, they always in a chase for mirage.
the ontology of the protestors now is the definition of freedom, justice, and bread in consideration of the current global crises, and shortcomings of the western definitions, and most importantly, the definition of freedom, justice, and democracy are motivated by oppression, exploitation, alienation of the overarching dominating power, mythological, religion, kingly, militant, or capitalistic, the correct definition for those terms won't start from Europian spring, radicalism of French revlution, reviving renaissance, causes of regression in the middle ages, golden age of rome, greek philosphy, but the solutions goes beyond to the old civilization of fertile cresent from the Nile river to the Tegris, those definitions are a revolution, and struggle against the domoinating hierarcy of the Egyptian temple, and sumarian ziggurt, and rightful defintion of democracy exists in hour history, the freedom is defined around the beauty, and simplicity of the mud, sand, and palm trees, the justice it goes as far as the old methology, the strugle between the old egalitarian goddess, and the despotic demigods, the solutions are in the decoding of the struggle between the egalitarian goddesses in the village, clan, and the overarching god, and demigod in the state, the definition of justice, freedom, and decmocracy is this first struggle of 5000BC to 8000BC in the middle East, the definitions, slogans, and emblems of our revolution need to trace the turning points in history to the first struggles.
the social contract, or constitution for the new Egyptian society can't be successful without consideration of our differences, and characteristics, it's can't be defined from oriental point of view, Egypt, and the Middle East is much bigger than those defintions, the element of to society are deep rooted int he old history, and need to be decoded and appreciated for example, the solution of religious intollerance is solved through the old nature of Egyptian predating the state of 7000 years old, and beyond, the nature of the land of thousands god, and goddess, and god as the ideal symbol of virtue, the ecological problem are solved around the holy nile river, and god habi, in respect to habi, from respect of ecology the problem of bread is solved, from the rising awareness to the ecological problems, and nature of our land, the demand of 'bread' can be solved. the solution of sexual harassement starts from the study of regression of role of goddesses hathor, and izis this turning point have the solution, not the oriental liberal human rights based off exploitation!  the solutions of justice, and freedom are drawn from the old autonomous Egyptian farmers in the village, and thier collaborative capacity to achive self-sufficience to the village.
a regional constition need to consider the uniquenss, and characteristics of the region, and Egyptian constition need to consider the different elements that constitue the Egyptian society, North, South, Nubia, sinai, oasis, and the cost, different languages, Egyptian Arabic Dialects, Coptic, Nubian, and Siwi, the different races and constituants African, north African, Nubian, Arabic, Middle Eastern, Europian, it need to provide the autonomy on the level of the region, a confedration of unique fedration connection by common characteristics, federation of Delta, fedration of the Southern, federation of the Nubia, fedration of Sinai, fedration of oasis, fedration of costs,  with autonomous constitution, governance, jurisdiction, economy, self-defense, education, and healthcare, all requirement of autonomy need to be satisfied through the expertise, and resources of each autonomy, each fedration requires recognition of constituent elements of it's society, for example the recogniation of the power of village, and governing council of the village in the southern fedration, the tribe, in the Oises, and sinai, the commune in the Northern, and costal fedrations, the power of each constituent need to start from the individual, for example from the communalist in the north, or costal fedration, or tribal, and villager in the wouth, the decision making is the aggregation of those effected by the decision, the decision on trade is only exclusive o traders, the decision making inside the factory is left to the wisdom of the engineers entrusted by the communalists in each commune, or village inside the confedration, and so on, the pyramid of power need to be fliped from the base to the top, the top, or the presidential decision making is by definition the result of the decision making of every communalist.
the yells, and calls of protestors need to change, if we need to bring any solution, the emblems, and slogans need to represent the suffrage, problems, demands, and solution, otherwise, the shy virgin, will eventually be violated by organized power!
